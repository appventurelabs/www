# Harnessing the Power of Day of Supply Calculations in Retail: Elevate Your Shopify Store with "What's Left"

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of retail, inventory management is a critical aspect that can make or break your business. One of the most useful metrics in this context is the 'Day of Supply' (DOS) calculation. This measure provides a clear view of how long your current inventory will last based on your sales rate, helping you maintain optimal stock levels. For Shopify store owners, the application ["What's Left"](https://apps.shopify.com/whats-left) could be the game-changer you're looking for, providing an effortless way to track your products' DOS.

## Understanding Day of Supply (DOS)

The Day of Supply is a critical KPI (Key Performance Indicator) in inventory management that helps predict the number of days remaining before a product goes out of stock, considering the current sales rate.

In simple terms, DOS = (Current Inventory / Average Daily Sales).

A lower DOS indicates that your stock might run out soon, while a higher DOS suggests you might be overstocked. In both scenarios, being aware of your DOS can help avoid lost sales or excess inventory costs, respectively.

## Benefits of Using Day of Supply Calculations in Retail

1. **Minimize Stockouts and Overstocks:** Keeping an eye on DOS allows you to restock your inventory just in time to avoid stockouts and lost sales. Conversely, it prevents overstocking, which can lead to unnecessary storage costs and potential wastage.
2. **Improved Cash Flow Management:** By optimizing inventory based on DOS, you can better manage your cash flow. Money that might otherwise be tied up in excess inventory can be used for other business growth activities.
3. **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** When you maintain optimal stock levels, you're more likely to meet customer demand promptly, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
4. **More Efficient Operations:** DOS calculations can inform your purchasing decisions, leading to more efficient operations and better relationships with suppliers.
